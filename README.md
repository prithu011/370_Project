⚽ Football Transfer Market Simulator

This project is a full-stack web application built for CSE 370, simulating the dynamics of the football transfer market. It features both client and server components and allows users to engage in realistic transfer activities such as buying players, signing free agents, and managing club budgets.

🧠 About the Project

The simulator gives each user a virtual budget of €1000000000 to build and improve their squad. Users can negotiate transfers with other clubs or scout for free agents, just like real-world football managers. The system handles the financial logic, player ownership, and market constraints, offering a strategic and engaging experience.
